# ColorfulPortals

  * You can color the activation glow effect of any portal using RGB and HTML color codes!
  * Those without the mod will still see the vanilla yellow/red glow effect.

## Instructions

### Changing portal glow effect color

  * In-game, press F1 to bring up the ConfigurationManager and navigate to the ColorfulPortals section.
    * Change the target color using the RGB sliders or using an HTML color code.

  - Hover over any portal ***that you are the owner of*** and a prompt to change its color will appear.
    - This prompt can be hidden by disabling the `showChangeColorHoverText` setting.

  * Hit `LeftShift + E` (configurable) to change the color of the portal glow effect.

### Stone portals

  * ***Stone portal*** prefabs activate and connect properly in vanilla.
