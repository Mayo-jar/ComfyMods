# ColorfulLights

  * You can color any torch, firepit, stone hearth and bonfire using RGB and HTML color codes!
  * Those without the mod will still see yellow torches, green guck torches and standard yellow fireworks.

## Features

### Color any torch or fireplace

  * In-game, press F1 to bring up the ConfigurationManager and navigate to the ColorfulLights section.
    * Change the target color using the RGB sliders or using an HTML color code.
  * Hover or any torch or fireplace and a prompt to change its color will appear.
    * This prompt can be hidden by disabling the `showChangeColorHoverText` setting.
    * Prompt font-size can be configured with the `colorPromptFontSize` setting.
  * Hit the hot-key `LeftShift + E` (configurable) to change the color.

### Launch colored fireworks

  * Colors applied to any campfire, hearth or bonfire will also color any fireworks launched from that fireplace!
  * Players without the mod will see the standard firework color.

## Notes

  * This is the *good enough* release with more features/options to be added later.
